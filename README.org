#+title: Ansible-FAI - Fully Automatic Installation
* This Repository moved to https://codeberg.org/berzdev/ansible-fai
* Description
I created this project for an automated FAI installation with Ansible on a multi location environment.
So that I'm able to install Debian everywhere in a few minutes, fully automatically.

FAI is a tool for unattended mass deployment of Debian machines ([[https://fai-project.org/][fai-project.org]]).
* Features
- Distributed Setup (Multi Location)
- UEFI and Legacy PXE Boot
* Deployment Types
** Local Setup
(Default Setup of the project)
- FAI is installed on a Debian Host
- Good for simple deployments (without multiple locations)
- PXE is preconfigured from FAI (all in one machine)
** Distributed Setup
This method is for scale in a multi site environment.

- The FAI configuration is on a central git repository
- The FAI Root Filesystem is stored on S3 (.img)
- Multiple TFTP servers are deployed via Docker (on any site), the PXE Folder is on S3 as ~tar.xz~.

* Get started (Local Setup)
** 0. Requirements
- Clone this repository
- Ansible
- A clean debian host (for FAI installation)
- Configure your DHCP Server for PXE boot (see Heading DHCP configuration)
** 1. Configure your deployment
a) Edit your Ansible ~hosts.yml~ (change faitmp Host IP).

b) Configure your Variables ~playbooks/vars.yml~ (change fai_server_ip).
** 2. Deploy FAI
Now you can run the ~fai.yml~ playbook!
This will install FAI on your fresh Debian host.
#+begin_src shell
  ansible-playbook playbooks/fai.yml
#+end_src
** 3. Test the setup
If no error occurs, FAI should now be installed!
You can check if the FAI folder exist under ~/srv/fai~.

When your DHCP server is configured for PXE boot, you can check if PXE boot works.

** 0. Requirements
- Clone this repository
- Ansible
- A clean debian host (for temporary FAI installation, until everything is published)
- Configure your DHCP Server for PXE boot (see Heading DHCP configuration)
- Docker Host(s) on your edge site (for TFTP container)
- S3 Bucket (FAI Root and FAI TFTP directory)
- Git Repository (for FAI config), with README file (repo must be initialized)
** 1. Configure your deployment
a) Edit your Ansible ~hosts.yml~
b) Configure your Variables ~playbooks/vars.yml~
- Add your git & S3 credentials (consider Ansible Vault for this)
** 2. Deploy FAI
Now you can run the ~fai.yml~ playbook!
This will install FAI on your fresh Debian host.

The git repository should now receive new files. Your Root Image + PXE archive should be uploaded to the S3 Bucket.
#+begin_src shell
  ansible-playbook playbooks/fai.yml
#+end_src
** 3. Deploy a TFTP Server (on docker)
Edit the file ~pxe.yml~ and probably change the ~container_directory~ variable at the beginning.
This is the place, where the TFTP server and all files will be installed.

The TFTP container will be exposed to port ~69/udp~ of the docker host. 
You should configure your DHCP server for this. See heading *DHCP configuration* for examples.
** 4. Test the setup
If everything is successfully uploaded & configured, check if you can boot over PXE.
* DHCP configuration
You must configure PXE Boot on the DHCP Server, so that PCs can find your FAI Server.
The following examples are tested & used in my setup.
** kea dhcp
- Support UEFI and Legacy Boot
